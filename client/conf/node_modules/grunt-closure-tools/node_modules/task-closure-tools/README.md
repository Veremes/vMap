# Task Closure Tools

The core library for the Closure Tools task, includes:

* **[Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/)** Compile your JS code using the powerful google closure compiler
* **[Builder](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/docs/closurebuilder)** Concatenate your JS codebase to a single file, optionally also compile it
* **[DepsWriter](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/docs/depswriter)** Calculate dependencies of your JS files and generate `deps.js`

## Applications

You can use the Closure Tools library as:

* A Grunt plugin [Grunt Closure Tools](https://github.com/closureplease/grunt-closure-tools)
* [Mantri](http://mantrijs.com) Depends on Closure Tools.

## Getting Started
